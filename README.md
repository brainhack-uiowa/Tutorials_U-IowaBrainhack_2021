%%%% We recommend the following tutorials: 7,8,9,10, and 12. 

%%%% We also want to recommend Dr. Talbert's youtube series. He does a great job of providing visuals and walking you through the more complex use of loops and conditional statements in Matlab.

June 24th: Please take the time to review our materials here and work through the practice problems linked below.

We use all that we have covered in order to work with EEG. Happy coding :)

% Here is a massive bank of problems from Matlab: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/cody/problems?term=group%3A%22Cody+Challenge%22&sort=created+asc
% We encourage you to get more and more familiar with what matlab and mathworks has to offer (google is your friend!!!) :)
